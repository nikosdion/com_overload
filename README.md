# Overload!

Mass Joomla! sample content creator

## Executive summary

This script will create a large amount of content to simulate a busy real world site. This is useful for developing Joomla extensions or Joomla itself. 

You can configure how many categories and articles to create, as well as where the content will be placed into. The text for category descriptions and article contents is dynamically generated random text ("Lorem ipsum"). 

**WARNING!** This script is only meant to be run on sites you are ready to throw away and start over. Using its default configuration will overwrite all of your site's content. If you're not careful you can completely trash a site. If unsure, take a backup before using this script, e.g. using [Akeeba Backup](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/akeeba-backup/).
